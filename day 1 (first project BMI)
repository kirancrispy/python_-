Instructions
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
BMI Wikipedia Page
The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.

Example Input 1
1.75
80
means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75
Example Output 1

solution:

height = input()
weight = input()
# Your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)
# Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# or using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_as_int)

input:
1,63
69

output: 25
