Welcome to my Python learning journey! Over the next 100 days, I will be diving deep into Python programming by creating a diverse range of projects. This structured approach will help me build a solid foundation in Python and develop practical skills that can be applied to real-world problems.

Goals
Consistency: Code and learn every day for 100 days.
Project-Based Learning: Focus on hands-on projects that cover different aspects of Python.
Skill Development: Improve problem-solving skills and understanding of Python's capabilities.
Documentation: Keep a detailed log of my progress, including code snippets, challenges faced, and solutions found.
