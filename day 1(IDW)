Write a Python program that calculates the Ideal Body Weight (IBW) from a user's height and gender. 
The IBW is an estimate of a healthy weight based on height.
The formula for calculating IBW is different for men and women:
For men:
IBW=50+2.3×(height in inches−60)
For women:
IBW=45.5+2.3×(height in inches−60)


  what is idw.?
  Ideal Body Weight (IBW) is an estimate of a healthy body weight based on a person's height and gender.
  It is calculated using different formulas for
  men and women to determine a target weight range that is considered healthy.

solution:

def IDL_Calculation(height,gender):
    if gender.lower()=="men":
        ibw = 50+2.3*(height - 60)
            
    elif gender.lower()=="women":
        ibw = 45.5+2.3*(height - 60)
    else:
        print("gender must be 'male' or 'female'")
    return round(ibw)
def main():
    height=float(input("enter your height in inches:"))
    gender=input("enter your gender :")
    ibw = IDL_Calculation(height, gender)
    print(f"Your Ideal Body Weight is:{ibw} kg")
    
if __name__ ==  "__main__":
    main()

output: 
enter your height in inches:71.2
enter your gender :men
Your Ideal Body Weight is:76 kg
